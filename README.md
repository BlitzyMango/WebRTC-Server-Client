# RTC Data Streaming Program
This project contains a server program that transmits continuous images to a client using the asynchronous 
implementation of WebRTC for Python, known as aiortc. Note: some necessary and expected features for the 
server and client programs have not yet been implemented, which means that these programs will not produce
the correct output, and that the source code may still have errors when cloning and debugging.
